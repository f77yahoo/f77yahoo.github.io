      <p class="p5"><span class="s4">For the first time Ukrainian artists SVITER art-group & Ivan Svitlychnyi are participating in the international festival for art and digital culture <i>transmediale Vorspiel 2018</i>. This group is presenting a site- and sound specific installation in which drum machines and electronic synthesizers create a unique algorithm that converts data inside the gallery into audio tracks in real time. Based on the former project <i>Untitled</i> (2017), presented at the Ukrainian pavilion on the 57th Venice Biennale, VERBATIX has been transforming into an archive, that acquires personal attributes and becomes an equivalent of a hyperlink.
      </span></p>
      <p class="p6"><span class="s4">VERBATIX is constantly and currently reshaping itself, it has acquired personal attributes and has begun the transformation to some sort of hyperlink – it combines intermedia with the conditional «text». In this case the «text» becomes an archive: the documentation and information that constantly updated through contextual queries. They provide data array for the generation of algorithmic sound installation. The archive also shapes the visual space, in which using projection and video, all the layers of information appear simultaneously. </span></p>
      <p class="p6"><span class="s4">Hyperlink represents a new form of interaction with reality. As Lev Manovich wrote in his “Language of new Media”, hyperlinks are the most radical and disruptive innovation of texts. VERBATIX distort information and, being a hyperlink, simultaneously creates a new product - hypertext, an archive of different time frames and spaces. This navigated space is a medium for telling a story which an observer can perceive using the medias of archive.  Hyperlinks transform our interaction with information and increase participant’s perception of news credibility. On the other hand, a distortion take place right at the moment when information is being separated from its source. New media creation technology allows to create new types of illusions, taken at face value. </span></p>
      <p class="p5"><span class="s4"><b>SVITER ART GROUP</b> <b>(LERA POLIANSKOVA and MAX ROBOTOV)</b> started in Kharkiv first as a musical project in 2009.
